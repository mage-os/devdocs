# Directory Structure Documentation

[TOC]

## Introduction

This documentation provides an in-depth understanding of the directory structure used in Mage-OS and Magento 2 projects. A
well-organized and logical directory structure is crucial for efficient development and maintenance of complex
applications. By following the recommended structure, developers can easily locate, modify, and extend code while
adhering to best practices. This documentation will outline the main directories, their purposes, and provide specific
examples and code snippets to illustrate the concepts.

## Root Directory

The root directory of a PHP or Magento 2 project contains essential files and directories necessary for the project to
function. Let's examine the common files and directories found in this root directory:

1. **app**: This directory contains the majority of your application code and configuration files. It is the heart of
   the Mage-OS / Magento 2 application and contains several subdirectories, including:

   - **code**: This directory is home to your custom PHP modules, organized by vendor name and module name. For
     instance, if you have a module named "MyModule" developed by "MyVendor," the directory structure would
     be `app/code/MyVendor/MyModule`.

   - **design**: This directory contains your theme-specific files, such as HTML templates, CSS stylesheets, and
     JavaScript files. The structure follows the same pattern as the `code` directory, with themes organized by vendor
     name and theme name. For storefront themes `frontend` folder will be used and for admin themes `adminhtml` need to be created.

   - **i18n**: This directory is used for internationalization (i18n) purposes. It contains translation files for
     different languages, allowing your application to be easily localized. Translations are organized by module and
     theme.

2. **vendor**: This directory is created when you install dependencies using Composer. It contains all the third-party libraries and modules your project depends on. It is generally recommended not to modify files in this directory directly.

3. **bin**: This directory contains command-line scripts used for various development tasks. For Magento 2 projects, it includes useful scripts like `magento` for running CLI commands and `setup` for installing and upgrading the application.

4. **dev**: The `dev` directory is used for development-specific tools and configurations. It may contain additional scripts, debugging utilities, or profiling tools.

5. **setup**: This contains all files which are related to Magento’s installation setup

6. **pub**: This directory houses publicly accessible files that are served directly by the web server. The directory contains the index.php file, which is used to run the application in production mode. It helps protect your project by preventing direct access to the root directory. You’ll also find the generated static files for your Magento theme here.

7. **var**: This directory is used for storing various types of data generated by the application at runtime. It typically includes log files, compiled code, caches, sessions, and generated static files. You should ensure this directory is writable by the web server.

8. **lib**: This folder contains all of Mage-OS’s core files and vendor libraries. It also includes Mage-OS code that isn’t part of a module.

9. **dev**: his folder contains automated functional tests that are executed using the Magento Test Framework.

## Conclusion

Understanding the directory structure of a PHP or Mage-OS / Magento 2 project is crucial for efficient development and maintenance. By following the recommended structure outlined in this documentation, developers can easily navigate and manage their codebase, resulting in a more organized and maintainable application. Use the provided examples and code snippets to gain a deeper understanding of the concepts discussed.
