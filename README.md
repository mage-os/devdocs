# Hello, Mage-OS Developer! 👋

Welcome to the Mage-OS DevDocs repository. If you're here to contribute, or even just to learn, we're thrilled to have
you. Below are some guidelines and notes to make your experience with us smooth and beneficial for everyone.

## 🎉 Every Contribution Counts!

We genuinely mean it when we say every contribution counts. Did you spot a typo? Feel the need to correct a spelling
issue? Even these small gestures go a long way in enhancing the quality of our DevDocs. So, don't hesitate. We
appreciate your keen eyes!

## 📋 Issues & Topics

If there's something you'd like to see documented or feel something's amiss, don't just keep it to yourself. Open up an
issue! We're always on the lookout for topics that can add value to Mage-OS DevDocs.

## 🗺 Navigation & New Pages

Want to add a new page? Great! Make sure you reference it in the documentation.md which serves as our central
navigation. This ensures everyone can find your valuable addition.

## 📄 Formatting & Structure

Every document you create should start with a `# Headline` and be followed by a `[TOC]`. This helps in generating the
Table of Contents. We plan to add help in the form of GitHub Actions to point out potential Layout Flaws, misspellings,
toxic language, non-inclusive language, or similar issues.

## 🗣 Tone & Voice

Documentation can often feel like a tedious read, but not here. While we aim to be exact and knowledgeable, we also
strive to be beginner-friendly. Put on your informative cap, but remember, our readers range from beginners to experts.
Aim for clarity and simplicity.

## 🖼 Images

A picture's worth a thousand words! If you'd like to add images to your documentation, please place them in the media
directory. This helps keep things neat and organized.

## 🚀 Keep It Simple

We've designed this repository to be as straightforward as possible. You'll mostly find Markdown files and the media
directory here. No fancy structures. No complicated workflows. We like to keep things light and breezy.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

A portion of our initial documentation was crafted with the assistance of artificial intelligence. While it has provided
valuable insights, not everything has undergone a human review or validation. We're continuously working on enhancing
and verifying the content, but if you spot any inaccuracies, do bring it to our attention.

## Contribution Guidelines

This repository is part of a 2-repositores project structure:

If you want to build devdocs locally or understand more on the build process, please refer to https://github.com/mage-os/devdocs-website too.

If you are submitting documentation for the **current stable release**, submit it to the corresponding branch. For
